I am trying to go back in time, years ago, when I was trying to learn how to program in shell and got confused with so many forms to perform comparisons in the shell, most of that by using external commands such as grep, awk and sed, among others.
Here I am going to concentrate in the embedded comparison methods, which in general, are more performing for variables comparison.</description></item></channel></rss>
