## Introduction

Hey you, if you are a software developer, the chance you have used some open source
software (OSS) is very high. Actually the software ecosystem in the current days is
highly dependent in OSS.

Open source (usually) means a software which you are free to download, use and have
profit with it. But more important, they are open for modifications and enhancements
by anybody. In opposition to closed softwares, you can see their source code.

## Which OSS you can contribute?

I don't know which programming languages you know, so let me list a few OSS projects
you might have heard and you are earning money with it:

### Java

- **_Spring Boot_** if you are a Java

Who never heard about **Python** or **JavaScript**? Both of them are open source programming
languages, which (usually) means they are free to download, use and have profit with
it. But more important, they are open for modifications and enhancements by anybody.

If you are earning money by using an OSS, why not using your talents to contribute and make
it better?

Okay, okay, Python and JavaScript, althought I am sure you could make a difference, are not
the easiest projects to work with. They are programming languages after all, their compilers
or interpreters are written in C or C++ for efficience, which means you would need to deal
with very low level codes, related to compilation and/or interpretation.
